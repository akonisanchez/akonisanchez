## Hi there, I'm AJ! ðŸ‘‹

ðŸŒ± **Impact-Driven Professional | Aspiring Developer**  
With a background in ESG and impact investing advisory, Iâ€™ve honed my skills in aligning businesses with sustainability goals and creating meaningful change. My journey has taken me through the world of software investing, and now, as a Customer Success Account Director, I thrive at the intersection of technology and people.

ðŸ’» **New Horizons in Tech**  
Iâ€™m diving into the world of programming, building projects with Python, Flask, HTML, and CSS. Iâ€™m passionate about using tech to streamline processes, solve complex problems, and create tools that make a difference.

This space is where I explore, learn, and share. Whether it's crafting apps or contributing to impactful projects, Iâ€™m excited to connect, collaborate, and grow.
